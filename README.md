# Embers Kernel

**An open-source, Rust-first microkernel research project for AI-oriented operating systems.**

We're investigating what the kernel should control when applications and AI agents compete for CPU time, memory, and eventually accelerator resources. The aim is a small, predictable enforcement layer: capability-based authority, explicit resource budgets, isolation, and measurable performance.

**This is a research effort, not a working general-purpose operating system or a benchmark-proven AI-optimized kernel.**

## The engineering idea

**Keep enforcement deterministic; keep intelligence outside the trusted kernel.**

- **Original microkernel:** target Rust `no_std`, x86-64 and reproducible QEMU experiments. This is not a Linux fork.
- **Capabilities, not ambient privilege:** explicit authority for memory, processes, IPC, and eventual compute resources; test revocation and stale-handle behavior.
- **AI-aware without AI in the kernel:** untrusted user-space services may propose scheduling or resource policies, but cannot grant themselves authority.
- **Bounded resources and fair fallback:** investigate CPU budgets, admission, latency, starvation, and safe recovery before attempting accelerator integration.
- **Evidence before claims:** compare proposed adaptations against deterministic baselines; measure IPC costs, tail latency, overhead, and failure behavior.

Embers Kernel is **separate from Emberglass OS**, a Linux-based Rust operating-system environment. They explore related questions but do not share a working kernel.

## Where the code actually stands

The default branch **boots a freestanding Rust `no_std` kernel in headless QEMU** and includes early exception handling and physical-frame bookkeeping. It is not yet a protected microkernel.

| Milestone | On `main` | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M02: Rust boot | Limine loads the ELF, bounded COM1 diagnostics, `READY` | [#26](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/pull/26) |
| M03: CPU exceptions | Kernel GDT/TSS/IDT; deliberate #UD, #PF and #DF QEMU tests | [#27](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/pull/27) |
| M04: memory map | Validate Limine descriptors; bounded, unique physical-frame accounting | [#28](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/pull/28) |
| M05: frame ledger | Fixed-capacity symbolic owners, cross-owner rejection and **permanent quarantine** | [#29](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/pull/29) |
| Proposed research | Capability and AI-aware resource policy architecture | [ADR #3](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/pull/3), [policy model #6](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/pull/6), not kernel features |

**Not implemented:** kernel-owned page tables, hardware-enforced user/kernel isolation, ring-3 processes, syscalls, IPC, authenticated capability enforcement, DMA/IOMMU quiescence or a deterministic multitasking scheduler. Frame ledger owner IDs are internal demonstration labels, not secure process identities.

A passing QEMU or host-test check proves only the tested milestone. It does **not** establish hardware isolation, kernel-level capability enforcement, production security, scheduler superiority, or a functioning AI operating system.

**Next proposed engineering boundary:** [M06 page-table transition contract](docs/PAGING_TRANSITION_V1.md) specifies the required memory mappings, frame reservations, failure behavior, and QEMU evidence before Embers can safely replace Limine's page-table root. It is a review proposal, not a completed milestone.

## Boot Embers in headless QEMU

**Development emulator only. Do not boot on physical hardware.** On Ubuntu or WSL2 Ubuntu, install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs) and then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel.git
cd embers-kernel
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y make binutils python3 qemu-system-x86 xorriso curl tar
cd rust-kernel
rustup toolchain install 1.90.0 --component clippy,rustfmt --target x86_64-unknown-none
cd ..
make rust-check
make rust-iso
qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu max -m 256M -cdrom build/embers-rust.iso \
  -display none -serial stdio -monitor none -no-reboot
```

The serial log should contain `READY: Embers Rust no_std entry reached.`. The intentionally halted kernel keeps QEMU running; stop the emulator with Ctrl+C. The measured emulator baseline is documented in [the Rust boot notes](rust-kernel/README.md): `-cpu max` is retained as a control profile and `qemu64` is the current minimum **tested emulator** model. This is not a minimum hardware requirement.

Run the pure-Rust memory and ownership tests independently of QEMU:

```bash
make rust-memory-test
make rust-ledger-test
```

For the four-mode exception smoke test, see [M03 exception instructions](rust-kernel/M03_EXCEPTIONS.md); for allocation and ownership semantics see [M04](rust-kernel/M04_PHYSICAL_MEMORY.md) and [M05](rust-kernel/M05_FRAME_LEDGER.md). The [CI workflows](.github/workflows/) run these against supported development-emulator configurations.

The earlier C prototype remains accessible as [historical PR #2](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/pull/2). It is **not** required to build or execute the Rust kernel.

For the host-only policy experiment, check out [PR #6](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/pull/6) and run `cargo test` in `experiments/rust-policy-guard`. That does not execute a privileged Rust kernel.

## Help build it

We're looking for contributors interested in **Rust systems programming, kernel bring-up, x86-64/QEMU, capability security, IPC, concurrency, scheduling, model checking, and reproducible benchmarks**.

A useful first contribution is a narrow, verifiable improvement, not a sweeping rewrite:

- **First contribution, documentation:** [Reproduce the Rust QEMU boot on a fresh Ubuntu/WSL machine](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/issues/8).
- **First contribution, code review:** [Document the early-boot `unsafe` contracts](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/issues/33).
- **Intermediate, architecture:** [Measure the Rust kernel's tested x86-64 CPU baseline](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/issues/9).

For deeper research, see the [capability threat-model task](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/issues/12) and the [contributor-launch milestone](https://github.com/bit-foundry-labs/embers-kernel/issues/24).
